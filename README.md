The P√£ozim project was created to be developed during the [Introduction to Software Systems Development (MAC0350)](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAC0350) course. The developed platform allows customers to subscribe to bakery products near their location and receive these products daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on their request. It is also possible to make individual orders from bakeries and customize the shopping cart as desired.

### Frontend üì≤

The frontend of the application was developed using Kotlin with XML styling. The app is designed to run on Android phones. Orders made in the app are updated in real time. It is also possible to rate completed orders, and the user remains logged in after exiting the app, which greatly improves usability.

Since the video recording, we have updated the subscription operations, and now the listing looks like this [signature_list.jpg](signature_list.jpg) and the payment screen looks like this [signature_pay.jpg](signature_pay.jpg).

### Backend üíª

The connection between the backend and the frontend is made through ngrok. [Link to ngrok tutorial](https://medium.com/desenvolvendo-com-paixao/ngrok-do-localhost-para-o-mundo-5445ad08419)

Variables to check before running the app:
- <i>BASE_URL</i> in [frontend/app/src/main/java/com/mobile/paozim/retrofit/RetrofitInstance.kt](frontend/app/src/main/java/com/mobile/paozim/retrofit/RetrofitInstance.kt)
  - It should be the URL provided by ngrok.

When running the server, make sure to update the following variables:
- <i>jdbcUrl</i> in [backend/src/main/kotlin/com/pao/repositories/DatabaseFactory.kt](backend/src/main/kotlin/com/pao/repositories/DatabaseFactory.kt)
  - It should include your database name (here named "pao") and the password (here "database").

The database used is PostgreSQL.
To use some test data, after running the server for the first time, you can import data from the [dadosTeste](dadosTeste) folder. To do this:

1. Open pgAdmin 4 and go to your database.
2. Go to Tables.
3. Right-click on the table you want to populate.
4. Select Import/Export Data.
5. Enter the filename and in the options tab, set ';' as the delimiter.
   
- To avoid foreign key issues, follow this order: user, sellers, items, categories, and rating.

### How to run the project üö®

Assuming you are using the Android Studio IDE to view and edit the code, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Backend through IntelliJ (it will run by default on the endpoint `localhost:8000`).
3. When the Backend is running, open another terminal and run `ngrok http 8000`.
4. After that, copy the public address generated by `ngrok` and paste it as the value of the `BASE_URL` string variable in `frontend\app\src\main\java\com\mobile\paozim\retrofit\RetrofitInstance.kt`.
5. Open the repository folder in Android Studio.
6. Sync Gradle.
7. Set up the Android Emulator or connect a physical device to install the app build (you might need drivers depending on your phone's manufacturer).
8. Run the project in Android Studio.

After this, the app should work normally on your configured device or emulator!
